    </p>

        <p>
            TSA is where school turned into “here’s a slightly unhinged challenge,
            go solve it with engineering and vibes.” it pushed me into events i
            wouldn’t have tried on my own and forced my brain into full problem-solving mode.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">some highlights</p>
        <ul>
            <li>competing in events that mixed engineering, creativity, and time pressure</li>
            <li>working with teammates to pull projects together right before deadlines</li>
            <li>going to nashville for nationals and living on caffeine + adrenaline</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i got out of it</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how to break big problems into “we can actually finish this” chunks</li>
            <li>how to present ideas in a way judges and normal humans understand</li>
            <li>a lot of proof that i weirdly thrive under chaos</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            10/10 would stress over design docs and presentations again.

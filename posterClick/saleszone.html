            saleszone is a business management + retail platform that my family has been
            building for years, and i kind of grew up around it. eventually i stopped just
            watching and started helping with the tech side, especially the ai vision and coolie robot.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i’ve helped with</p>
        <ul>
            <li>working on ai vision setups that track customer footfall in real stores</li>
            <li>building and testing parts of the system that talk to cameras + dashboards</li>
            <li>also working on a modified robot that would work on shelf replenishment</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">why it’s cool</p>

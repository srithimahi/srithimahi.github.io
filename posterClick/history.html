        not just dates. more like: why did people do that, and what broke because of it?

            i like history because it’s basically the world’s longest, messiest story.
            it’s not just “memorize this timeline,” it’s figuring out how one decision,
            one invention, or one very stubborn person changed everything after them.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">things i love about history</p>
        <ul>
            <li>following one event and seeing all the unexpected consequences after it</li>
            <li>learning how tech, politics, art, and culture all tangle together</li>
            <li>realizing that people in the past were just as dramatic as we are</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">how it shows up in my work</p>
        <p>
            history sneaks into my projects through worldbuilding, research ideas,
            and the questions i ask: “who is this for?”, “what happens if this scales?”,
            “what does this change long-term?”
        </p>

        <p class="project-note">
            tl;dr: yes i am the type of person who will pause a movie to rant about the
            historical context for 10 minutes.

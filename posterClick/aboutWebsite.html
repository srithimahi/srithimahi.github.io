    <h1 class="project-title">about this website</h1>
    <p class="project-subtitle">
        a poster wall, some chaos, and way too many tiny layout decisions
    </p>

    <section class="project-content">
        <p>
            this site started because i didn’t want the Serious Developer Website™ with
            grayscale cards and bootstrap vibes. i wanted something a bit more chaotic.
        </p>
        

        <p class="project-section-title">what this site is for</p>
        <p>
            this isn’t just “look at my projects”; it’s more like a little museum of things i’ve
            sunk time and braincells into: robotics, research, art, competitions, random ideas
            that somehow turned into real things.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what might happen later</p>
        <ul>
            <li>wayyy more posters as i inevitably collect new projects</li>
            <li>possibly a blog or devlog area if i decide to overshare even more</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            tl;dr: this website is my “here’s everything i care about, but make it cute” space.

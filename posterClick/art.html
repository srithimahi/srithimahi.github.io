        drawing, painting, and making my brain calm down for five minutes

        <p>
            i’ve always bounced in and out of “art phases” since the "lockdown" era. 
            now i draw a lot of girls with intense expressions, weird lighting, and the
            kind of color palettes that probably belong on album covers.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i like making</p>
        <ul>
            <li>character art with dramatic lighting and moody faces</li>
            <li>some ridiculously colored-in character from random anime</li>
            <li>sketchbook pages full of experiments that may or may not go anywhere</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            not everything here is “finished” or “portfolio-ready.” some of it is just
            me, trying things and seeing what feels right.

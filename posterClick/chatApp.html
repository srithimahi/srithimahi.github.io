    <h1 class="project-title">chat app</h1>
    <p class="project-subtitle">
        a tiny app where messages go brrr (and i learned way too much about sockets)
    </p>

        <p>
            this started off in a boring saturday as well "i want something to do" and then turned
            into me spiraling into networking, message formats, and ui behavior. i wanted
            something simple and can happen in a single computer.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what it does</p>
        <ul>
            <li>lets multiple users connect and chat in real time</li>
            <li>handles basic usernames and message display</li>
            <li>keeps the interface clean and not cursed-looking (cause it did have that phase)</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="project-note">
            it’s def not discord, but for something built from scratch by one sleep-deprived
            person, i’m pretty fond of it.

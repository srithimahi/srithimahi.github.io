            i’m not a super Serious Photographer™, but i like capturing little moments:
            weird lighting, sky colors, and anything that looks like it could be a frame 
            from a movie.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i like shooting</p>
        <ul>
            <li>city lights at night and nightlife on rainy streets</li>
            <li>clouds doing something dramatic cause they are sassy</li>
            <li>small details that most people walk past without noticing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            half my camera roll is “accidental” shots that ended up looking better
            than the ones i tried to pose.

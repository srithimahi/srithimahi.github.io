        documenting light, colors, and the occasional unintentional cinematic moment

        <p>
            i’m not a super Serious Photographer™, but i like capturing little moments:
            weird lighting, empty streets, sky colors, and anything that looks like it
            could be a frame from a movie or anime opening.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i like shooting</p>
        <ul>
            <li>city lights at night and reflections on wet streets</li>
            <li>clouds doing something dramatic for no reason</li>
            <li>small details that most people walk past without noticing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">how it connects to everything else</p>
        <p>
            photography messes with my sense of composition and color in a good way.
            it sneaks back into how i frame ui layouts, choose color palettes, and even
            how i think about scenes in my art.
        </p>

        <p class="project-note">
            half my camera roll is “accidental” shots that ended up looking better
            than the ones i tried to pose.

        a club for people who think “what if we just built it ourselves?”

        <p>
            hack club coppell started this year with me and a bunch of my friends cause we wanted 
            to do something in our senior year. We have our fun workshops and meetings with 
            interesting games...
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what we do</p>
        <ul>
            <li>build random projects just because they sound fun or cursed</li>
            <li>mess with web dev, hardware, games, and whatever else members wanna do</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            it’s less “formal club” and more “group of gremlins who like building things
            and occasionally remember to take photos.”

    <h1 class="project-title">hack club coppell</h1>
    <p class="project-subtitle">
        a club for people who think “what if we just built it ourselves?”
    </p>

    <section class="project-content">
        <p>
            hack club coppell is our little corner of builders, coders, and people who
            show up saying “i have an idea, but i don’t know where to start” and leave
            with a half-working project and three new obsessions.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">what we do</p>
        <ul>
            <li>build random projects just because they sound fun or cursed</li>
            <li>mess with web dev, hardware, ai, games, and whatever else people bring in</li>
            <li>help each other debug things that broke five minutes before a demo</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">my role in all this</p>
        <ul>
            <li>helping organize, brainstorm, and keep the chaos vaguely structured</li>
            <li>supporting people who are new to coding but want to make something real</li>
            <li>bringing my own projects in and letting people poke at them</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            it’s less “formal club” and more “group of gremlins who like building things
            and occasionally remember to take photos.”

        <p>
            robotics is where my “what if we just automated that” brain gets to be loud.
            i like the mix of code, hardware, problem-solving, and the very specific joy
            of watching something physical move because of something i wrote.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">stuff i’ve worked on</p>
        <ul>
            <li>school robotics class projects, from basic bots to more cursed experiments</li>
            <li>hands-on work with sensors, motors, and making everything not catch fire</li>
            <li>tying robotics ideas into real-world things (like automation and retail systems)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-title">what i like about it</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you can actually <em>see</em> your code doing something in the real world</li>
            <li>debugging is annoying but also kind of like solving a puzzle</li>
            <li>it connects nicely with ai vision, automation, and my “let’s overengineer this” side</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-note">
            i fully believe robots should be slightly chaotic and full of personality.
            otherwise what’s the point.

        <p>
            this started as a “what if” question: what if buildings could cool themselves
            without air conditioning screaming in the background 24/7? no vents, no
            massive fans, just smart geometry and wind.
        </p>

        <p class="project-section-title">the basic idea</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a tall, lotus-like tower that catches cooler, faster wind higher above the ground.
            </li>
            <li>
                that wind is funneled downward into underground channels, where the earth naturally
                cools it.
            </li>
            <li>
                the air is then released back at street level, creating a gentle, cooler airflow
                through urban spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
                the shape avoids the classic “venturi effect scream” and aims for smoother, 
                more controlled airflow.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p class="project-section-title">what’s next</p>
        <p>
            i’m turning this into a proper research piece: diagrams, airflow reasoning,
            and use cases for hot, dense cities. the plan is to
